        <p>In a 1994 book, German scholar Echard Sander argued that the Snow White tale is based on a real person, Countess Margarete von Waldeck of Bavaria.<br/> The countess was raised in an area where children working in copper mines were so stunted that they were called dwarfs.</p>
        <p>The Grimm fairy tale gets a Technicolor treatment in Disney's first animated feature.<br/>Jealous of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent stepdaughter, <br/>but later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven friendly little miners.<br/> Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White, who falls into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince.</p>
